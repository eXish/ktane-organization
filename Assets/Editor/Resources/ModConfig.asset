  description: 'And you thought organizing in real life was tough...


    Solve the modules on a bomb in the order specified by one of these modules.


    Mission creators, if you wish to have specific mod settings used on your bombs
    you must put this string in your mission description to set their values:


    [Organization] value, value, value, value

    where value is either true or false.


    The order for the settings in this string from left to right are ignoreSolveBased,
    enableMoveToBack, disableTimeModeCooldown, and useSwitchVersion. The spaces after
    each comma are optional.
